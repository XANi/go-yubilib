# go-yubilib

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/efigence/go-yubilib?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/efigence/go-yubilib)


Primitives for operating with Yubikeys (mostly around OTP parts).

Assumptions:

* most stuff like keys are encoded in hex, to be compatible with the [reference](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-ksm-dpkg/blob/master/ykksm-utils.php) implementation
